# decoder-mk2-kai
This project is meant to showcase a decoder ring that works off of three possible encoding/decoding options. Polybius, caeser, and substituion. 
the page has a guide for each on how to properly encode/decode. 
In this project multiple concepts were use to overcome challenges. The polybius cipher in particular was re-written to include,
a new technique that was learned midway through (use of unicode in order to check characters). So pieces of the original code do function 
hand in hand with this replaced code in order to ensure that the concept was understood and properly functioning.
